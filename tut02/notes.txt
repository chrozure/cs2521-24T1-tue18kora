Hello everyone, and welcome to week 2!

I didn't get to meet you all last week, so here is a little bit about me:
    - My name is Harry, and I am a 4th year student studying Computer Science and Science (Mathematics)

In this tutorial we will be looking at:
    - Recursion
    - Analysis of Algorithms

Admin stuff:
    - This code is available on a Github repository
    - You can get lab01 handmarked today or next week
    - This week's lab has no handmarking (fully automarked)







So, what is recursion?
    - Recursion is a way of solving problems where
    a problem is solved by solving a small part of it first,
    and then leaving the rest of it as a smaller "subproblem"

Why should we use recursion?
    - It can make our code look a lot simpler
    - Some problems are easier to solve when a recursive approach is used
    - Some programming languages do not have loops (you have to use recursion!)




Downsides of recursion:
    -



Analysis of algorithms
What is big-O?
    - A way of quantitatively describing how fast or slow an algorithm runs at scale


How do we calculate it?
