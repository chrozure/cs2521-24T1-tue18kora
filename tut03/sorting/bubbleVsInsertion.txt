Let's compare the performance of bubble sort vs insertion sort!

Bubble Sort:
    - iterate through the array
        - if you find two adjacent numbers that are in the wrong order:
            - swap them around
    - repeat until the array is sorted

    - Best case:
    - Worst case:

Insertion sort:
    - split the array into a sorted and unsorted part
    - iterate through the array, and at each element:
        - insert it into the sorted side by shifting it 1 at a time

    - Best case:
    - Worst case:


1. Sorted input
Bubble sort:
    1 2 3 4 5

Insertion sort:
    1|2 3 4 5



2. Reverse-sorted
Bubble sort:
    5 4 3 2 1

Insertion sort:
    5|4 3 2 1



3. Sorted, except the first and last elements are swapped
Bubble sort:
    5 2 3 4 1

Insertion sort:
    5|2 3 4 1
