Welcome to week 3!

In this tutorial we will be mainly focusing on sorting algorithms!
Sorting algorithms are used everywhere, but you probably have never thought too much about it.

Admin stuff:
    - This week is the last week you can get lab01 marked!

    - In this week's lab, there is no coding but you
        will instead need to write up a report
    - lab03 is fully handmarked, and you have until week 5 to get it handmarked
        but you MUST submit it by next Monday!
    - You can also do lab03 in pairs!


Sorting algorithms:
    - Here is a cool video which helps you visualise
        (and audiolize) sorting algorithms:
